📦 Package Description
Advy Chat is a Flutter package that allows developers to seamlessly integrate an in-app customer support chat system into their applications. With minimal setup, you can provide real-time chat functionality to your users, enhancing communication and support within your app.

This package includes a fully functional chat interface for end users. Messages sent by users are routed to a centralized admin dashboard (not included in this package) where admins can monitor and respond to conversations.

✅ Features
🔌 Easy integration with just a few lines of code

💬 In-app real-time chat for users

🎨 Customizable and responsive UI

🔒 Secure communication architecture

🛠 Built for scalability with a backend-admin panel (separate from this package)

🚫 Note
This package does not include the admin dashboard. The admin panel for viewing and responding to user messages is maintained separately and should be integrated via your backend infrastructure.

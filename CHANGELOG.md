## 1.1.9

- Refactored `AdvyWidget` to use a `StatelessWidget` with draggable functionality via `GetX`.
- Improved customization: now uses colors, icon size, and border properties defined in the widget.
- Ensured the widget is ready to be integrated as a floating support chat button across applications.
- Added safe `Obx` wrapper for reactive position updates.
